    <p>My passion for motorcycles began with a spontanious date with a bearded boy on a cherry red Ducati Monster. I
        have always been
        interested in cars, but I never paid attention to motorcycles, thinking they were too expensive and dangerous
        for
        my lifestyle as a BYU college student. The Ducati date, however, proved me wrong. <em>I realized a motorcycle
            was everything I had been missing in life.</em> The thrill, the speed, the sounds all made me feel
        whole. Thus began my obsession and quest for <strong>my own</strong> motorcycle</p>
    <p>Four months after my first date with Caleb, the Ducati Monster guy, I was seriously shopping for my own bike. My
        parents were supportive of my passion, so they were helping me choose a beginner motorcycle. Behind the scenes,
        Caleb was also helping me find my perfect bike. I was excited to learn how to ride and maintain a motorcycle to
        one day own a Ducati Monster like Caleb.</p>
    <p>To my surprise, Caleb found a Ducati Monster 750 for me in great shape and at an astonishingly low price on KSL.
        <br>I could not miss out on this opprotunity, so I bought it. </p>

    <h2>Specs</h2>
    <p>Outlined below are customizations made to my motorcycle. When I first purchased it, the bike was bone stock. It
        was like a blank canvas ready to be painted.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tank dent repair</li>
        <li>Custom black paint job on tank and front fender</li>
        <li>Giugiaro 80's Ducati tank logo in yellow</li>
        <li>Corbin seat with yellow piping</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are the <strong>top 3</strong> modifications I want to make to my Ducati in the near future.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the front fender</li>
        <li>Add reflective rim tape</li>
        <li>Custom valve stem cap</li>
    </ol>
